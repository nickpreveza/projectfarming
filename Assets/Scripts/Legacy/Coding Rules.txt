Coding Rules (Add to this when things come up)

General rules:
camelCase is used in most cases
Use private variables as much as possible to hide information that shouldn't be altered outside the class.
Name variables and function of what they are or what they do.
Avoid one variable names that are hard to understand. like one letter variable names. like a..b...c. unless used as iterators in loop or similar.

Sorting
Membervariables on top of the class so they are always easy to find
Function sorting? In order of importance? or in run order?

Variable names start with small letter.
exemple: warrior or warriorHat

Method/Functions start with big letter
example: Follow() or FollowPlayer()

Class names always start with big letter:
example: MyClass

Constants Always big letters, Can be seperated with underscore:
Example: SPEED, TOP_SPEED

Enums?
example: 

Abstract Classes / interface.....same as classes for now??
example:
